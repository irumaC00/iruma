	<section id="center">Welcome to DreamsLinked!
<p>After launching beta, hammering nails, pushing ourselves over the edge, we have come closer to creating a product that fulfills a purpose.
Showcasing talent, defining it with skills, pushing innovation into Massachusetts, bringing the Silicon Valley experience to everyone's doorstep.
The folks at DreamsLinked have their work cut-out for them. One thing we realize is that, you can't fail until you try, and sometimes you can't succeed unless you fail.
To prove that fear is only of the mind, you have to take that step, against all odds, and push forward regardless of who believes in you.
You have to believe in yourself more than anyone else, to achieve what you set out to do.
At DreamsLinked, we believe everyone has talent, and people's skills define their talent.
We believe innovation breeds positivity, and with its light we can follow the path to success. 
More importantly, that sometimes people's light dims out over time as the fire in their hearts begin to simmer.
It is our job to bring the torch of perseverance, and lend you some of our fire, to help ignite a flame that will burn for the rest of your life. 
Hopefully, you will pass that flame on to the next person, and the next, to fill the hearts of those around us with a positive light, and a burning fire.</p></section>
